# **2048 Game**
## Project Overview
This project is a copy of the popular game 2048, developed entirely in JavaScript. The goal of the game is to combine numbered tiles on a grid to reach the 2048 tile. Players can move the tiles in four directions, and when two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one with a doubled value. The game ends when there are no more moves left or the player reaches the 2048 tile.
